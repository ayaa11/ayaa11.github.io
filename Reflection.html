               <p>This tutorial is about learning JSON which I had chosen it for the assessment because it is interesting to learn it. I had a little experience on how to use it, but now I improved myself using it. JSON is helpful in converting the data of JavaScript objects between a browser and web, so I can use it to call some data to the web. The experiences that I had used JSON with, it is when I wanted to do a game for a group project coursework using unity tool. We used to call the questions that written for the game in JSON which made it easier to write it in another file.</p>
               <p>The tutorial covers some Knowledge of learning JSON. In the beginning, I wanted to use a free template in order to build the website more static and flexible to use. Then, I decided to challenge myself and practise what I had learned before about making a website. However, I believe that the used template can make my website more usable. While I am searching on JSON, I found many interesting topics like how to create the hero information card using this technique. However. I had tried to cover the essential subjects as much as I can with code examples and videos.  The resources that attracted me most, such as <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_comparison.htm">TutorialsPoint</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON">MDN Mozilla Developer Network</a>. Also, I enjoyed choosing a background image from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/search/background/">Pexels</a> and picking the social icons from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>.</p>
               <P>JSON is short of  <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>N</strong>otation which is an independence language. Although, Crockford had the thought that JSON related to JavaScript, because it used with curly braces, square brackets and commas. It helps to transport data easily by parsing an object or array. The most used functions in JSON are <strong>JSON.stringify()</strong> and <strong>JSON.parse()</strong> which they work in the oppositely. I had learned that I could use JSON to make a table by creating the list in a function using HTML then show the data by the function getElementById. Also, use it for drop-down list by the function <strong>XMLHttpRequest()</strong> and <strong>JSON.stringify()</strong>. Moreover, I realised that we could use JavaScript objects and arrays as JSON. However, it has advantages more that disadvantages such as fast, easy to use and able to share data. One of the most impacts that it is not hard technology to get started with that allow using it within the favourite web development environment.</P>
               <P>I had not faced many difficulties while learning JSON because I had a little experience in using it. However I had struggled in making the template takes a long time I could not to make it responsive enough especially in tutorial 4 the page I could not fix it, so I would make it better in the future. Furthermore, I went through most of the topics, and I found that JSON browser could be helpful to builds native components. Therefore I might use it for my mobile application project to have a native app. Moreover, in the future, there are lots I need to learn that relate to JSON.</P>
               <P>This tutorial could interacts people who would learn a different technology like JSON. I had tried to include the most subjects that useful for learner like <strong>JSON</strong> vs <strong>XML</strong> and <strong>JSON</strong> <strong>HTML</strong>. Also, I wanted to write about <strong>AJAX</strong> with <strong>JSON</strong> because it is a good topic to include. But I thought it should focus on a specific topics and make it more interesting. Therefore, I think it could have written more knowledge about JSON. For that reason, I have written some further resources in the references page. However, I liked and enjoyed writing this material, I am sure people can learn from it and like it.</P>
